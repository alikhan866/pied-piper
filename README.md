# Pied Piper
`PiedPier` is an open source, realtime graph creation/execution or in simple terms aggregation engine which along with https://github.com/thehellmaker/pied-piper-ui will let any user build a backend API without any coding knowledge for most common usecases. 

## Haven't you ever been sick of coding?

- Have you ever been sick of writing **lots of code** just to make a HTTP call?
- Have you ever been sick of **writing unit tests and integration tests** for all the code you just wrote to make this simple HTTP call?
- Have you been sick of now setting up a **CI pipeline** to ensure everything is tested before the it goes to prod?
- Have you ever been sick of now figuring out **where to host your API** and doing all the setup to get your API running?

If the answer to all or any of the questions been yes then here's pied piper. This project aims at helping developers and others build request response APIs by just building a graph of the control flow using a UI and let pied piper handle the rest for you.
